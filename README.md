This application will allow Wholesalers and Investors to connect in an efficient manner for getting deals done.

Wholesalers constantly complain about not being able to find investors and investors constantly complain about not being able to find wholesalers.  This application will solve the issue by allowing a wholesaler to upload their properties and send to their connected investors.

Investors will be able to search for wholesalers within the application which will allow more opportunities for them to find and close deals.  Lenders will be able to join and connect with wholesalers and investors.  With all three parties involved, more real estate deals can happen.

At the moment, investors looking to invest out of state have many difficulties finding deals.  Building up trust is tantamount to success and the goal of this app will be to allow investors to have better access to real estate deals, including out of state, and to establish a network of wholesalers around the country that they can trust.

Currently, investors need to rely on being on a buyers list, which amounts to essentially an email spam list.  This application will provide a user interface for all potential deals the investor will be sent.  Having all of the details and pertinent photos of the properties will allow for better, easier, and quicker decision making for the investor.

# Future iterations and features:
- User being able to upload necessary loan documents for easier loan-approval process between investor and lender
- Investors creating a syndication
- In-app messaging system
- Tiered levels of membership where vetted Wholesalers will be able to access the best investors
